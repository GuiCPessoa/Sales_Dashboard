## üìö Learning
I continue to learn more and more about React and its technologies. I really enjoyed doing this project because I worked with other technologies, and I started to gradually get into the backend of an application, understanding and making HTTP requests, such as POST, GET, and others. The project is not finished yet, I want to add some more features to it!
